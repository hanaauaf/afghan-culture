Poetry, music, intricate crafts, and a deep respect for community play a central role in everyday life, reflecting the warmth and depth of Afghan culture.</p>

                        <p>Afghan cuisine is a flavorful reflection of the country’s geography, history, and hospitality. Meals often center around rice dishes like kabuli pulao, served with tender meat, raisins, and carrots, while breads such as naan are a staple at every table. Spices are used subtly to enhance rather than overpower the food, creating comforting and balanced flavors. From savory dumplings like mantu and ashak to rich stews and seasonal fruits, Afghan food is both nourishing and symbolic of community, where sharing meals with guests is a cherished tradition. </p>
